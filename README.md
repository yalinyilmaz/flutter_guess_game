# flutter_guess_game

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
 It is very simple guessing and finding the winner number game.
 Your scores are being recorded in each game and the scoreboard shows how many guesses it takes to find the winner number.
 Hive was used as Local DB.
 Try and check out. 
 Don't forget you can expand the history by expanding the scoreboard table. I put a limit of 5 to show the all-time scores.
